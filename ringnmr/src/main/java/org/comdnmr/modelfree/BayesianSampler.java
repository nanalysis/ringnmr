/**
 * Bayesian bootstrap sampler that draws observation weights from a symmetric

 * integer-valued resampling counts with continuous weights drawn from
 * Dirichlet(α, …, α) with α = 1 (the uniform Dirichlet prior). Each call to
 * {@link #sampleWeights()} returns a weight vector whose elements sum to
 * {@code nValues} rather than 1, so that the downstream weighted least-squares
 * objective is on the same scale as the unweighted case.
 *
 * <p>This sampler can be called an unlimited number of times, unlike
 * {@link NonparametricSampler} which exhausts after {@code nSel³} draws.
